  "summary": "REQ-16 requires updating all years of experience references to '12 years' or '12+ years' across the website. The diff shows modifications to HeroSection.tsx, frontend-file-summaries.txt, and project_state.json. Evidence indicates the HeroSection.tsx was modified to include trust indicators showing '12+ years of experience'. However, the diff does not show changes to other sections mentioned in the requirement (About, Services) where experience might be referenced. The file summaries mention 'updated value proposition' in About and 'refined descriptions' in Services, but without explicit evidence of experience value updates in those files, we cannot confirm full implementation.",
